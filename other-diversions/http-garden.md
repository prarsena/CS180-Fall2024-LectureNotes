The work of the guy I sat next to on the plane, who introduced me to the idea of using the grim reaper in ASCII art.  HTTP Garden - github.com/narfindustries/http-garden

Web server HTTP headers should use the Latin1 encoding of bytes, but sometimes they use UTF8. This leads to some web servers and data being exploitable.
