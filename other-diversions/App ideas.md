We are learning programming fundamentals, but why? I started class by saying that programming allows you to turn your ideas into reality. It lets you express yourself creatively and productively. 

The BEST way to learn programming is to come up with a solution to a problem that you have. The problem can be extremely **small** and **trivial**. As long as it's a REAL problem that you have! Once you solve it, you may find use cases for your solution that are extremely **big** and **important**. 

Here are some examples: 

- I thought the pixelated effect from movies and TV shows when they blur someone's face was very cool. I wanted to see what my photos would look like blurred like that (*inciting idea/insignificant problem*). I Googled how to do it, and learned I could probably do it with Adobe. But I didn't want to pay them $100s of dollars (*bigger problem*). So I wrote the [Grafx](../in-class-exercises/Grafx.java) program to pixelate images. 
	- I learned about how you can manipulate the value of each individual pixel using basic math. I started by inverting each pixel color (which gave me the invert method), and then learned how to average four pixels together to get four pixels of the same color (basic blur). Then I realized maybe you want to average 8 or 16 pixels together, or any size, for the Pixelate method.  

- I mentioned about my first programming project was downloading photos off of Tumblr because I was too lazy to right-click 50 photos (*inciting idea/insignificant problem*). I soon realized that I could download photos off other peoples' blogs by re-using my code (just changing the URL that I want to download photos from). I learned this was called web scraping. If you're good at it, you can be very useful to companies who thrive on collecting data. If you can collect and process the data (via Data Analytics), you will be super valuable to an employer. 

- I was in the grocery store recently talking to a friend who lives very far away. As a kind of joke, I said, "I wish you could see what I'm seeing. Maybe we should both buy Apple VR and I could stream what I'm seeing to you so it'd be like you're here with me." (*inciting idea/insignificant problem*) After I got off the phone, I thought about it. That *would* be extremely cool. What if you weren't just streaming for a friend, but if a company streamed in VR to people who have mobility issues? An immobile person could send a person to their favorite museum and give live instructions. (*big problem/ significant opportunity*) 

Anyway, the takeaway here is to start with a problem. 
- Can't remember how many reps you've done at the gym or how heavy they were?
- Want to connect with students who have or will sign up for the same classes as you so you can sell and trade text books?
