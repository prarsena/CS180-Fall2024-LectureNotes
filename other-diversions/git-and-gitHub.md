Someone once said: **Java is to JavaScript as Car is to Carpet**. Meaning they are in no way directly connected. Yes, they both have the word "Java" in their names, however, each language has its own syntax, plugins, frameworks, etc.

Git and GitHub have a much closer relationship than **Car** and **Carpet**

Parts of Java (the OpenJDK) are written in Java and hosted on GitHub.
The [java/util/Scanner class](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/java.base/share/classes/java/util/Scanner.java).
In fact, all our friends are there [classes/java](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/tree/master/src/java.base/share/classes/java).  Math.round, etc.
