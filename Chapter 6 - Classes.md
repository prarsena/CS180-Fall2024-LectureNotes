## TL;DR
Every Java file is a class. We say it's either Executable or an Object class.
- Executable classes have a `main` method which executes sequentially. (`TestRectangle.java`). These runnable classes. Inside of executable classes, you can create as many objects as you want, including custom Objects that you write. 
- Object classes don't have `main` method, not runnable. (`Rectangle`, `TestStudent`)
	- Object classes have fields. Fields are object descriptors. When you create an object, it has those fields. You can set those fields by writing **setter** methods or **constructors**. Object Fields are private. You write a **getter** method to access a field.

## Recap: Classes vs. Objects
In lectures, I use the terms "Class" and "Object" interchangeably. I ask, "Can someone name a Java Object?" and say "Classes have methods", but I am referring to the same set of things. 

Java Objects or Classes that we know include String, Scanner, File, PrintWriter, FileWriter, Random, Math, System, and (a bit of) the "wrapper" classes: Integer, Double, Boolean (which make Primitive Data Types behave like Java Objects).

In most cases it is okay that I use the terms interchangeably, but there is a technical difference between the two terms:

- **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.
- **Object**: An instance of a class. It is created based on the class blueprint and has its own state and behavior as defined by the class.

The class is like a blueprint, and the object is like house we build from the blueprint. In Java, the blueprint is usually flexible (and we can write our own blueprints). 

## Terminology for two types of classes: Executable vs. Object
For our purposes, there are two types of Java classes: 
- Those with a `main` method
- Those without a `main` method

I will call this distinction: **Executable classes vs. object classes**. 

- An executable class has a main method. These types of classes are also referred to as a Main Class, an Entry Point Class, or a Test Class (think: **TestRectangle.java**). 
- An object class is a blueprint that defines a Java object. It does not contain a main method. These types of classes are also referred to as a Helper Classes, Model Classes, or POJO (Plain Old Java Objects) (think: **Rectangle.java**).  
## Object Class: Fields and Methods
Object classes in Java have fields and methods. 

- **Fields** are the data stored about an object (Rectangle has `length` and `width` fields). Fields are like variables except they have an access modifier (`private` or `public`). Fields should be `private` so that other classes don't access the data directly. 
  
- **Methods** are the operations that an object can perform. We know methods from Chapter 5. Examples for object classes include a **set** and a **get** method for each **field** (For example, `setLength` and `getLength`).

A special type of method is a **Constructor**.  
- A constructor is a method that is automatically called when an object is created.
- Constructors are used to perform operations at the time an object is created.
- Constructors typically initialize instance fields and perform other object initialization tasks.

Here is the full `Rectangle.java` object class, which we will look at as we go:
```java
public class Rectangle {  
	private double length;  
	private double width;  
	  
	public Rectangle(double len, double wid){  
		length = len;  
		width = wid;  
	}  
	  
	public void setLength(double len){  
		length = len;  
	}  
	
	public double getLength(){  
		return length;  
	}  
	  
	public void setWidth(double wid){  
		width = wid;  
	}  
	
	public double getWidth(){  
		return width;  
	}  
	  
	public double getArea(){  
		return length * width;  
	}  
}
```

## Executable class: Using the Object class 
Executable classes are no different than every class we've seen this semester: They are the ones that have a `main` method. The only difference is that, within them, we initialize our custom Object class. 

Assume `Rectangle.java` and the following class (`TestRectangle.java`) are in the same directory (this way, we won't have to import anything): 

```java
public class TestRectangle {  
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
		Rectangle box = new Rectangle(8.5, 12.5);  
		System.out.println(box.getLength());  
		System.out.println(box.getWidth());  
		  
		box.setLength(10);  
		box.setWidth(10);  
		System.out.println(box.getArea());  
	}  
}
```

We initialize our Rectangle object like we would with a Scanner, File, or Random object. Then we run methods on the object. We also make use of the two argument constructor to set the default length and width of the rectangle. 

## Object methods: Getters and Setters
Although object fields are private, we may want to get and set their values. For every field you want to modify, write a get and set function for that field. Once you learn the "recipe", all getters and setters have the same syntax. For example:

```java
public class Thing {

	private String name;
	private int age;    
	  
	public void setName(String nm){  
		name = nm;  
	}  
	
	public String getName(){  
		return name;  
	}  
	
	public void setAge(int ag){  
		age = ag;  
	}  
	
	public int getAge(){  
		return age;  
	}  
}
```

The input parameter `String nm` would be used as the argument when you call the `setName()` method, like so:
```java
public class TestThing{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Thing a = new Thing();
		a.setName("Arnold");
		System.out.println(a.getName()); 
		a.setAge(10);
		System.out.println(a.getAge()); 
	}
}
```

An alternative way to write setter methods is like so:

```java
public class Thing {  
    private double gpa;  
  
    public void setGpa(double gpa){  
        this.gpa = gpa;  
    }  
}
```

Using the `this.{fieldname} = {fieldname}` syntax eliminates the need for misspelling or writing unclear variables. 

## Constructors: Set default values
If you don't initialize a field to some value, when you try to run and print a getter method, what will happen? 

You will print the default value of the data type. Here's a list of the values: 

| **Data Type** | **Default Value**           |
| ------------- | --------------------------- |
| `byte`        | `0`                         |
| `short`       | `0`                         |
| `int`         | `0`                         |
| `long`        | `0L`                        |
| `float`       | `0.0f`                      |
| `double`      | `0.0d`                      |
| `char`        | `'\u0000'` (null character) |
| `boolean`     | `false`                     |
| `String`      | `null`                      |

When an object is created, its constructor is always called.

If you do not write a constructor, Java provides one when the class is compiled. The constructor that Java provides is known as the **default constructor**.
- It sets all of the object‚Äôs numeric fields to 0.
- It sets all of the object‚Äôs boolean fields to false.
- It sets all of the object‚Äôs reference variables to the special value null.

When defining our Object class, however, we could set default values for fields. 
```java
class Car {
	private String make = "Ford";
	private String model = "Escape";
}
```

But this is not flexible. We are stuck with pre-defined values for our object (either the data type default, or hard-coded defaults like the Ford Escape above).

Let's say we write a Java class called Car and it had the following properties:
```java
public class Car {
	private String make;
	private String model;
	private int year;
	private String color;
}
```

We can add Getter and Setter methods to access and mutate the object data. But we can also create an object constructor to set the values at instance creation. Here's a constructor for the Car Object class:

```java
public class Car {
	private String make;
	private String model;
	private int year;
	private String color;

	public Car(String mk, String mdl, int yr, String col){
		make = mk;
		model = mdl;
		year = yr;
		color = col;
	}
}
```

Here is an alternative way to write the above constructor using the `this` keyword:

```java
public class Car {
	private String make;
	private String model;
	private int year;
	private String color;

	public Car(String make, String model, int year, String color){
		this.make = make;
		this.model = model;
		this.year = year;
		this.color = color;
	}
}
```

Additionally, you can also create a multi-arg constructor like this:
```java
public class Car {
	private String make;
	private String model;
	private int year;
	private String color;

	public Car(String make, String model, int year, String color){
		this(make, model, year, color);
	}
}
```

If we want to use the Car object in another class, we'd instantiate a car with the arguments in the specified order, like so: 

```java
public class TestCar {
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
		Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2024, "red");
		Car yourCar = new Car("Ford", "Escape", 2020, "blue");	
	}
}
```

One great thing about objects is that you can instantiate (create) as many as you need. In the above example, we've created two car objects, `myCar` and `yourCar`. If we have getter and setter methods, we can access and change information about each car separately. 

### Constructor properties
Constructors have a few special properties that set them apart from normal methods.
- Constructors have the same name as the class.
- Constructors have no return type (not even void).
- Constructors may not return any values.
- Constructors are typically public.

### No-arg Constructors
The default constructor is a constructor with no parameters, used to initialize an object in a default configuration. This is seen in an Executable class when you run this statement (for example):

```java
Rectangle box = new Rectangle();
```

There are no arguments in the parentheses because you are creating a default object. 

The only time that Java provides a default constructor is when you do not write any constructor for a class.

When you write your own constructor, for example, with two args (as you might see in Rectangle), like so:

```java
public Rectangle(double length, double width){
	this.length = length;
	this.width = width;
}
```

If you try to create a Rectangle object with no-args, you will get an error! However, this can be remedied by adding a no-arg constructor to the Rectangle object class (like so):

```java
public Rectangle() {
}
```

See **Overloading classes** for more info. 
### The String class constructor
One of the String class constructors accepts a string literal as an argument.
This string literal is used to initialize a String object.
For instance: 
`String name = new String("Michael Jordan");`

This creates a new reference variable name that points to a String object that represents the name ‚ÄúMichael Jordan‚Äù. Because they are used so often (String is a special object), we usually just say: ``
`String name = "Michael Jordan";`


## Calculated methods: Prevent Stale Data
Above in our Rectangle class, we have a fifth method, `getArea()`, which looks like this:   
```java
public double getArea(){  
	return length * width;  
} 
```

This method calculates the area at the time it's called. This allows us to return a dynamic value of the rectangle‚Äôs area when the method is called. For example:
```java
public class TestRectangle {  
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
		Rectangle box = new Rectangle(8.5, 12.5);  
		System.out.println(box.getArea());  
		//Returns 106.25
		  
		box.setLength(10);  
		box.setWidth(10);  
		System.out.println(box.getArea());  
		//Returns 100.0
	}  
}
```

It would be impractical to use an `area` field in the Rectangle class because data that requires the calculation of various factors has the potential to become stale.

To avoid stale data, it is best to calculate the value of that data within a method rather than store it in a variable.

## Instance Fields and Methods
(Slide 37-38)
The most important distinction between methods (chapter 5) is between Static and Non-Static methods (which are known as INSTANCE methods). 

Instance methods allow you to create numerous instances of an Object class, and work with them independently. For example:

```java
Rectangle kitchen = new Rectangle(12.5, 12.5);
Rectangle mainBedroom = new Rectangle(18.0, 13.0);
Rectangle kidBedroom = new Rectangle(14.0, 8.0);
```

Those three "rooms" hold different addresses in memory -- three different objects, three different instances of a "room" object class. In the memory location for each room is a field for length and width (slide 39).

## Overloading methods
Two or more methods in a class may have the same name as long as their parameter lists are different.

An example is `Random.nextInt()`. It behaves different based on whether you give it zero input parameters, one input parameter, or two.

When this occurs, it is called **method overloading**. This also applies to constructors but then it is called **class overloading**.

Method overloading is important because sometimes you need several different ways to perform the same operation. You may want a user to be able to add two ints, or two doubles. So you can write a method for each data type:

```java
public int add(int num1, int num2) {
¬†¬† return num1 + num2;
}

public double add(double num1, double num2) {
¬†¬† return num1 + num2;
}
```

A method signature consists of the method‚Äôs name and the data types of the method‚Äôs parameters, in the order that they appear. The return type is not part of the signature.

The process of matching a method call with the correct method is known as **binding**. The compiler uses the method signature to determine which version of the overloaded method to bind the call to.

## Overloading classes
If you write multiple Object class constructors, you can initialize objects with different default values.

Let's say you had the Car class with four fields. 
You could write as many object constructors as you wanted from no-arg, to 1-arg, 2-arg, 3-arg, and 4-arg. You could also write the parameters in different orders depending on the business logic needed.  

```java
public class Car {
    private String make;
    private String model;
    private int year;
    private String color;

    // Constructor with all parameters
    public Car(String make, String model, int year, String color) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
        this.color = color;
    }

    // Constructor with default color
    public Car(String make, String model, int year) {
        this(make, model, year, "Unknown");
    }

    // Constructor with default year and color
    public Car(String make, String color) {
        this(make, "Unknown", 2024, color);
    }

	public Car(){
		this.make = "Unknown";
		this.model = "Unknown";
		this.year = 0000;
		this.color = "Unknown";
	}

    // Getters and setters...
}
```

This would give you the flexibility when creating a Car object to specify as many values as you know at instance creation time:

```java
Car profCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2024, "red");  
Car cooperCar = new Car("Vovlo", "S60", 2007);  
Car taylorCar = new Car("McLaren", "Light blue");
Car seamusCar = new Car();  
```

With Java, your constructor arguments must be in the correct order of an existing constructor.

### Optional reading: Optional values
Optional or named input parameters are not supported by default in Java! üòîüòì This is lame and definitely something I will look at after I am elected president of Java.  


## Uninitialized Local Reference Variables
You can declare a variable in an Executable class of your custom type without initializing it. ‚Ä¢A local reference variable must reference an object before it can be used, otherwise a compiler error will occur.

```java
public class MyClass{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Rectangle box;
		box = new Rectangle(7.0, 14.0);
	}
}
```

## Passing Objects as Arguments
Remember when we said that Methods take input parameters in parentheses? Example:
```java
public static void setLength(int length) {}

public static void setName(String name) {}
```

You can do the same with your custom objects:

```java
public static void displayRectangle(Rectangle r) {}
```

When you pass an object as an argument, the thing that is passed into the parameter variable is the object's memory address. As a result, parameter variable references the object, and the receiving method has access to the object.

```java
// Rectangle.java class
public static void displayRectangle(Rectangle r){
	System.out.println("Length: " + r.getLength() +
						"Width: " + r.getWidth());
}
```

When you pass an object as an argument to a method, the method will almost always be **static** and all the instance methods are available. 

## Returning objects from methods
Methods are not limited to returning the primitive data types. Methods can return references to objects as well. Just as with passing arguments, a copy of the object is not returned, only its address.

See example: ReturnObject.java

## toString() method
All objects have a toString() method that returns the class name and a hash of the memory address of the object. It is also called implicitly whenever you try to print the object: 

```java
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter("Filename.txt");  
System.out.println(pw.toString());  
// java.io.PrintWriter@5b480cf9
  
Die d = new Die(45);  
System.out.println(d);  
// Die@10f87f48
```

Some objects override the default toString() method, like `File` and `String`:
```java
File f = new File("Filename.txt");  
System.out.println(f);  
// Filename.txt
  
String s = "Sarah";  
System.out.println(s);  
// Sarah
```

When we create our custom objects, we get the default toString() method that Java provides:

```java
User sarah = new User("Sarah", "password", "Sunnydale High", "I‚Äôm 100% certain that I am 0% sure of what I‚Äôm doing.");  
System.out.println(sarah);  
// User@2f4d3709
```

But we can override the default method with our own to print out more useful information. Here's an example from the `User` class:

```java
@Override  
public String toString(){  
	String str = String.format("ID: %-7d Username: %s %nSchool: %s %nQuote: \"%s\" ", id, username, school, quote);  
	return str;  
}
```

Then, when we call the `User sarah` object again, the output is printed as we expect to see it. 

```java
User sarah = new User("Sarah", "password", "Sunnydale High", "I‚Äôm 100% certain that I am 0% sure of what I‚Äôm doing.");  
System.out.println(sarah);  

// ID: 39930    Username: Sarah Wilson 
// School: Sunnydale High 
// Quote: "I‚Äôm 100% certain that I am 0% sure of what I‚Äôm doing." 
```
