## Intro to Arrays
- Primitive variables are designed to hold only one value at a time.
- Arrays allow us to create a collection of like values that are indexed.
- An array can store any type of data but only one type of data at a time.
- An array is a list of data elements.

An array is an object so it needs an object reference:
```java
// Declare a reference to an array that will hold integers.
int[] numbers;
```
The next step creates the array and assigns its address to the numbers variable:
```java
// Create a new array that will hold 6 integers.
numbers = new int[6];
```

Array element values are initialized to 0.  
**Array indexes always start at 0.**

You can declare an array reference and create it in the same statement.
```java
int[] numbers = new int[6];
```

Arrays may be of any type (including objects):
```java
char[] letters = new char[26];
double[] temperatures = new double[7];
String[] daysOfWeek = new String[7];
```

The array size must be a non-negative number. It may be a literal value, a constant, or variable.
```java
final int ARRAY_SIZE = 6;
int[] numbers = new int[ARRAY_SIZE];
```

**Once created, an array size is fixed and cannot be changed.** You cannot add or remove items from an array after it is initialized. You can, however, do that with a different object: **ArrayList**. (For more information, see Slides 69-79.)

## Initialize Arrays with Custom Values
In the above examples, when we initialize an array using the following syntax:
```java
int[] numbers = new int[6];
```

the array is created using the default values of the data type. This works the same as in a Object class's Default Constructor, where fields are initialized to the default value of their data type. So the above six-element array has the following values: `{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}`.   





You can initialize an array with custom values by specifying them in curly brackets, like so:
```java
int[] daysInMonth = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};

String[] daysOfWeek = {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"};

char[] possibleGrades = {'F', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A'};
```

## Array Length
Arrays are objects which provide a public **field** named `length`. The length of an array can be obtained via its `length` constant field (which is defined as `public final int length`): 

```java
int numberOfMonths = daysInMonth.length;
System.out.println(numberOfMonths)
// 12
System.out.println(daysOfWeek.length);
// 7
```

**Note**: Array `length` is a **field**, not a **method**. String has a **method** called `length()`. In an Array object, you access the public field. In a String, you access the public method, which uses parentheses.  

```java
char[] possibleGrades = {'F', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A'};  
// Access the Array object's public field: length
System.out.println(possibleGrades.length);  

String s = "Sarah";  
// Access the String object's public method: length()
System.out.println(s.length());
```

## Accessing Elements of an Array
In our example array:
```java
String[] daysOfWeek = {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"};
```

Array elements are accessed by:
- the array name: `daysOfWeek`
- An index position within square brackets, for example: `[0]`

```java
System.out.println(daysOfWeek[0])
// Sunday
System.out.println(daysOfWeek[6])
// Saturday
```

 Array elements can be treated as any other variable. You can also assign or re-assign the values in the array using the following syntax:
 
 ```java
String[] cities = new String[3];
cities[0] = "Berlin"
cities[1] = "Beijing"
cities[2] = "Boston"

System.out.println(cities[0])
// Berlin
System.out.println(cities[1])
// Beijing
System.out.println(cities[2])
// Boston

cities[0] = "Bogota"
cities[1] = "Beirut"
cities[2] = "Bengaluru"

System.out.println(cities[0])
// Bogota
System.out.println(cities[1])
// Beirut
System.out.println(cities[2])
// Bengaluru
```

Alternatively, I can create an array with initialized values, and access and re-assign elements using same syntax:
```java
String[] cities = { "Berlin", "Beijing", "Boston"};
System.out.println(cities[0])
// Berlin
cities[0] = "Bogota"
System.out.println(cities[0])
// Bogota
```

## Important! Bounds Checking
Array indexes always start at `[0]` and continue to `[array.length - 1]`.

The `cities` array above was initialized with length `3`, but the final element in the array is `cities[2]`.  

Because **Array indexes always start at 0**, the last element in the array is **always** located at the `[length-1]` position.

If you try to access an array element that is at `array.length` position or greater, you will trigger an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. Here's an example in code:

```java
String[] daysOfWeek = {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"};  
System.out.println(daysOfWeek.length);  
// 7
System.out.println(daysOfWeek[0]);  
// Sunday
System.out.println(daysOfWeek[6]);
// Saturday
System.out.println(daysOfWeek[daysOfWeek.length - 1]);
// Saturday
System.out.println(daysOfWeek[7]);
//Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 7 out of bounds for length 7
//	at ArrayPractice.main(ArrayPractice.java:11)
```

Also notice that array index positions can be accessed using variables. You can always access the last element in an array using the `[array.length - 1]` subscript.

## Looping through Array Elements
Because Arrays have a known, fixed number of elements, looping through array elements is an ideal use case for a **for loop**. Here's the generic formula:

```java
for (int i=0; i < arrayName.length; i++) {  
	System.out.println(arrayName[i]);  
}
```

In for loops, it is typical to use i, j, and k as counting variables. It might help to think of **i** as representing the word **index**. 

Here's an example and explanation:

```java
String[] daysOfWeek = {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"};

for (int i=0; i < daysOfWeek.length; i++) {  
	System.out.println(daysOfWeek[i]);  
}
```

Here's what's happening:
1. Initialize a counter (`i`) to `0`.
2. Evaluate test condition: if `i` is less-than the length of the array, execute the statement, which prints the array element at position `i`. 
	1. `0 < 7`, prints `daysOfWeek[0]` which is  `Sunday`.         Increment `i`.
	2. `1 < 7`, prints `daysOfWeek[1]` which is  `Monday`.         Increment `i`.
	3. `2 < 7`, prints `daysOfWeek[2]` which is  `Tuesday`.       Increment `i`. 
	4. etc.. etc.. 
	5. `7 < 7` is not true. Loop exits.

You can also use for loops to assign array values:
```java
int[] squares = new int[20];  
for (int i=0; i < squares.length; i++) {  
	squares[i] = i * i;  
}  
System.out.println(squares[9]);
// 81
```

or use for loops to re-assign values:
```java
String[] daysOfWeek = {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"};
System.out.println(daysOfWeek[6]);
// Saturday

for (int i=0; i < daysOfWeek.length; i++) {  
	daysOfWeek[i] = daysOfWeek[i].replace("day", "yay").toUpperCase();
}  
System.out.println(daysOfWeek[6]);
// SATURYAY
```

It is very easy to be off-by-one when accessing arrays. When looping through arrays, use **less than** and **array.length** to be safe.  

## Tip: Avoid Printing "Item #0" to User
Computers start counting at 0, but humans start at 1. 
- The problem for your user is that it's odd to see "Enter ingredient #0: " 
- The problem for the computer is that if you initialize your Array For Loop at 1, you won't add a value to the first item in the array (which is position 0). 

The solution is to use 0 as the initial value of a for loop, and when you print messages to the user, use `(i + 1)`.

```java
for (int i=0; i < ingredientsList.length; i++){  
	System.out.print("Enter ingredient #" + (i+1) + ": ");  
	ingredientsList[i] = kbd.next();  
}
// Prints "Enter ingredient #1"
// Input is written to ingredientsList[0]
// and so forth.. 
```

This way, your user sees a number that makes sense to them, yet you're still writing to the correct position in the array. 

## Simplified Array for loop (read-only)
There's a simplified array processing syntax for reading elements only. You create a counter variable of the same data type as the array to hold each element (one at a time) while the loop executes the statement and then accesses the next element.

You can't re-assign elements this way because you don't refer to elements by their index, but rather by their value directly. The syntax is like this: 

```java
int[] numbers = {3, 6, 9};
for (int number : numbers) {
Â  System.out.println("The current number is " + number);
}
// The current number is 3
// The current number is 6
// The current number is 9

String[] daysOfWeek = {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"};
for (String day : daysOfWeek) {
	System.out.println(day);
}
```

## User-specified Array length and element values
While Arrays are fixed in length, you can allow a user to specify the size and elements of an array using a Scanner object. 

The following code prompts a user to enter the number of students, then allows the user to enter a name for each student:

```java
int numberOfStudents;
String[] students;

Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("How many students do you have? ");
numberOfStudents = keyboard.nextInt();
students = new String[numberOfStudents];

for (int i=0; i < students.length; i++){
	System.out.print("Name of student #" + i + ": ");
	students[i] = keyboard.nextLine();
}
```

## Passing Arrays as Arguments to Methods
Arrays are objects. Their references can be passed to methods like any other object reference variable.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	String[] daysOfWeek = {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"};
	printArray(daysOfWeek)
}

public static void printArray(String[] array){
	for (int i=0; i < array.length; i++){
		System.out.println(array[i]);
	}
}
```

## Returning Arrays from Methods
Arrays can be a method return type modifier. 

For example, if you had a method where you asked a user to enter ingredients, you can return an array of Strings by setting the return type as `String[]`:

```java
public static String[] getIngredientsFromUser(){  
	Scanner kbd = new Scanner(System.in);  
	System.out.print("How many ingredients are you using? ");  
	int numIngredients = kbd.nextInt();  
	  
	String[] ingredientsList = new String[numIngredients];  
	for (int i=0; i < ingredientsList.length; i++){  
		System.out.print("Enter ingredient #" + (i+1) + ": ");  
		ingredientsList[i] = kbd.next();  
	}  
	
	return ingredientsList;  
}
```

This method returns the array of ingredients that you can assign to a String array variable (the following example also loops through the array using the simplified array for loop syntax): 

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {  
	String[] ingredients = getIngredientsFromUser();  
	System.out.print("The ingredients in your sandwich are ");  
	for (String ingredient : ingredients){  
		System.out.print(ingredient + " ");  
	}  
}
```

## Stray observation: main(String[] args)
You have survived three months of Java instruction, you are now ready to learn the secret meaning of `public static void main(String[] args)`.

You can specify an array of strings that you can refer to as "args" and a positional index in any executable Java program. For example, you have a String array available to you by default. Here's how you access elements 1 and 2 from that array:  

```java
public class StringArguments {  
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
		System.out.println(args[0]);  
		System.out.println(args[1]);  
	}  
}
```

However, you can only pass in these arguments when running Java on the command line, and you must provide them yourself or you'll get an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The way you pass these arguments using the command line is like this (and the output):
```bash
java StringArguments.java "hi" "world"
hi
world
```

Alternatively, you can compile the program and then run it:
```bash
javac .\StringArguments.java
java StringArguments.java "hi" "world"
hi
world
```
## Array of arrays: 2D arrays
\[not on final exam]
(Slides 47 - 60)
An array of arrays in Java, also known as a multidimensional array, is a way to store data in a structured format. This is used in mathematical matrices, representing grids, or working with tabular data, like an Excel sheet. 

### Declare
You can declare an array of arrays using the following syntax:

```java
int[][] arrayName;
```

This declaresÂ `arrayName`Â as an array of arrays of integers.

### Initialize
You can initialize an array of arrays using theÂ `new`Â keyword:

```java
int[][] arrayName = new int[3][4];
```

This creates a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns. 
Alternatively, you can initialize it with specific values:
```java
int[][] arrayName = {
	{1, 2, 3},
	{4, 5, 6},
	{7, 8, 9}
};
```

### Access elements
You can access elements in a 2D array using row and column indices:

```java
int value = arrayName[1][2]; 
// Accesses the element in the second row, third column
```

### Iterating over elements
You can use nested loops to iterate over the elements of a 2D array:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < arrayName.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < arrayName[i].length; j++) {
        System.out.print(arrayName[i][j] + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

Example: `lengths.java`
### Ragged Arrays
Java allows you to create ragged arrays, where each row can have a different number of columns:
```java
int[][] raggedArray = new int[3][];
raggedArray[0] = new int[2];
raggedArray[1] = new int[3];
raggedArray[2] = new int[1];
```
